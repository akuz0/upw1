	",        8,"Multilevel inverters are widely used in industrial areas because it is suitable for medium and high power application. In the switching control of most of the multilevel inverters, sinusoidal PWM is most commonly used. But the difficulty faced in sinusoidal PWM is, the need of pure sinusoidal signal in the control. So, in order to avoid this limitation, another modulation known as the staircase modulation can be used in the control of MLI. This paper discusses about various staircase reference wave generation methods such as half height (HH) method, Half Equal Phase (HEP) method and Feed Forward (FF) method. The performance analysis of different staircase waves in control of MLI is carried out with an eleven level cascaded H Bridge Multilevel inverter using phase shift carrier modulation. The objective of analysis to find a method of staircase reference wave generation with lesser THD. The performance of 11 level CHB with different staircase reference signal is analyzed in terms of THD using Matlab/Simulink software.

The empirical evidence is based on Two Stage Least Squares (2SLS) and Instrumental Quantile regressions (IQR). From the 2SLS: (i) mobile phone and internet penetration rates reduce poor quality education and enhancing internet penetration has a net negative effect of greater magnitude. From the IQR: (i) with the exception of the highest quantile for mobile phone penetration and top quantiles for internet penetration, ICT consistently has a negative effect on poor education quality with a non-monotonic pattern. (ii) Net negative effects are exclusively apparent in the median and top quantiles of internet-related regressions. It follows that enhancing internet penetration will benefit countries with above-median levels of poor education quality while enhancing internet penetration is not immediately relevant to reducing poor education quality in countries with below-median levels of poor education quality.

	",       35,"A few decades after the four freedoms were introduced that allowed several types of financial intermediaries the freedom to provide services throughout all EEA Member States, it appears that this right is still undermined for depositaries providing services in European investment law.Interesting enough a de facto passport in this field already exists. CRD IV, IORPD II and MiFID II all regulate the safekeeping of securities and the provision of custody services. MiFID II lists the provisions of safekeeping services, including custodianship for financial instruments, as ancillary service and allows this service to be ‘passported’, in addition to, the principle investment activities/services for which investment firms are authorized. Similarly, CRD IV allows the safekeeping of securities and the provision of custody services to be passported, in addition to, the principle deposit-taking activity of credit institutions. Under IORPD II the safekeeping of securities and the provision of custody services are subject to a mutual recognition approach. IORPD II allows, in addition to UCITS/AIF depositaries, investment firms and credit institutions harmonized under the CRD IV and MiFID II to be appointed as a depositary regardless whether the depositary is established in the IORP home Member State. The PEPPR does not regulate this issue and, thus, also allows for a de facto depositary passport. Notwithstanding the fundamental principle of freedom to provide services, the AIFMD and UCITSD V only allow UCITS (ManCos) and AIFMs to appoint a depositary which is established or has a branch office in the EEA Member State in which the respective UCITS or AIF is established. Strictly speaking, credit institutions or investment firms which are under CRD IV, MiFID II and IORPD II allowed to provide custody services on a cross-border basis, may not exercise ‘passporting rights’ under the UCITS V and AIFMD, because these European directives preclude depositaries from doing so. It is therefore worthwhile to investigate whether depositaries under the AIFMD and UCITSD V should be allowed to enjoy passporting rights and whether and to what extent this fits in under the current ‘de facto passports’ available under European investment law. To that end, this contribution first discusses the inconsistencies in granting an European passport to depositaries/custodians under the European investment laws, i.e. the ‘European depositary passport paradox’. Second, the differences and similarities between depositaries and custodians under these laws are considered by applying the legal interpretation methods of Von Savigny on the study of positive norms to assess whether a differential treatment for the purpose of granting a European passport to (AIF/UCITS) depositaries is justified. Furthermore, this contribution addresses under what conditions a European/TC passport could be granted to (AIF/UCITS) depositaries. It concludes by suggesting a cross-sectoral depositary passport that could be considered and modelled after the cross-sectoral passport for investment management services.

By using the case of urban megaprojects research as an example of potential transdisciplinarity, the article explores concepts such as “centrality” and “bordering” in order to suggest distinct and yet interrelated ways to explain “power” and “growth” in a terrain – that of urban studies – subject to several disciplinary accounts that are typically not integrated. In opposition to the economic logic of urban megaprojects, it is suggested a particular idea of an “urban imagination” that contributes to establishing the transition to a more systematic and integrated understanding of megaprojects and urbanism under a transdisciplinary vision.  It is suggested that a transdisciplinary approach to urbanism as a methodology ought to take seriously the ethical ideal of inclusiveness, which fails to realize when we hold the belief that the outside world of things is not as deserving as the inner world of the mind, and when we privilege the perspective of epistemology over ontology, over the conscience of the eye and over the value of observations. When we build a transdisciplinary approach to urbanism, a key issue then is how to revive the “reality of the outside” both as a dimension of human experience and as a research strategy.

Is it theoretically possible to guarantee that this will not be the case? In this paper, we introduce mechanisms that make it simultaneously strictly dominant for the subject (a) not to acquire any information that could potentially lead to belief updating as a response to the incentives provided by the mechanism itself, and (b) to report his beliefs truthfully. Such mechanisms are called robust scoring rules. We argue that robust scoring rules are needed for eliciting unbiased estimates of population beliefs in surveys, and we prove that they exist under mild assumptions on the subject’s costs for acquiring information. Although not all standard scoring rules are robust, it is still the case that every scoring rule is approximately robust in the following sense: we can weaken the incentives enough so that the subject will want to acquire only limited amount of information (thus updating only to nearby posterior beliefs), but not enough so that the incentives to report truthfully vanish. As a result, any scoring rule can approximate with arbitrary precision the beliefs that the subject would have held if he had not been confronted with the belief-elicitation task.

We derive the kurtosis of returns, the autocorrelation function of squared returns, and the R^2 of a Mincer-Zarnowitz regression and evaluate these models in a Monte-Carlo simulation. For S&P 500 data, we compare the forecast performance of GARCH-MIDAS models with a wide range of competitor models such as HAR, Realized GARCH, HEAVY and Markov-Switching GARCH.

	",       32," In the South Slavic countries, it is common practice to use the names of today's nations when analyzing and classifying texts from past centuries. In this way, since the 12th century monuments have become evidence of ""Croatian"", ""Serbian"", ""Bosnian"" or ""Montenegrin"" literacy. To what extent, however, such an approach to old monuments is scientifically justified, can only be clarified by using interdisciplinary approaches. For this reason, modern sociological theories on the origin of nations form the starting point of the present paper, while works by historians and linguists make it possible to investigate which names actually appear in ancient sources, what they signify, and to what extent current practice of replacing some of these names with the modern national designations is justified. In den südslavischen Ländern ist es gängige Praxis, bei der Analyse und Zuordnung von Texten aus vergangenen Jahrhunderten die Namen der heutigen Nationen zu gebrauchen. Auf diese Weise werden Denkmäler seit dem 12. Jahrhundert jeweils zu Belegen der „kroatischen“, „serbischen“, „bosnischen“ oder „montenegrinischen“ Schriftlichkeit. Inwieweit jedoch eine solche Herangehensweise an alte Denkmäler wissenschaftlich begründet ist, lässt sich nur unter Einbeziehung interdisziplinärer Ansätze klären. Aus diesem Grund bilden die modernen soziologischen Theorien zur Entstehung von Nationen den Ausgangspunkt des vorliegenden Beitrags, während Arbeiten von Historikern und Sprachwissenschaftlern es ermöglichen, der Frage nachzugehen, welche Namen in alten Quellen tatsächlich auftauchen, was sie bedeuteten und inwieweit die aktuelle Praxis berechtigt ist, manche dieser Namen durch die modernen Nationalbezeichnungen zu ersetzen. U južnoslavenskim državama je uobičajena filološka praksa da se koriste imena današnjih nacija kad se opisuju tekstovi iz davnih stoljeća. Na taj način pisani spomenici sve tamo od 12. stoljeća postaju dokazi ""hrvatske"", ""srpske"", ""bošnjačke"" ili ""crnogorske"" pismenosti. No, je li takvo ophođenje sa starim tekstovima znanstveno utemeljeno? Odgovor na to pitanje može se dobiti jedino primjenom interdisciplinarnog pristupa. Zato se u ovom članku koriste spoznaje iz suvremene sociologije, historiografije i lingvistike. Kompozicija članka je: 1) Uvod, 2) Nastanak nacija, 3) Etnos/narod i nacija, 4) Južnoslavensko područje u 19. stoljeću, 5) Nazivi naroda, teritorija i jezika u povijesti, 6) Zaključak.

	",        1,"Ongoing globalization and increased taxpayer mobility not only exacerbate already existing shortcomings when allocating taxing rights but also legal mismatches in regard of access to welfare benefits and voting rights. All three legal areas (taxation, access to welfare benefits and voting rights) are of importance for those individuals who choose to cross-border work or relocate themselves to another state on a more permanent basis. The extent of this importance will, naturally, vary between taxpayer groups due to individual circumstances and needs. Yet some more general deductions may still be made. This paper identifies and analyses, through a traditional legal study, legal mismatches between taxation, access to welfare benefits and voting rights in Sweden. These three legal areas are analysed through the application of a taxpayer case study consisting of six classical taxpayer groups commonly found within international taxation. The result of the study illustrates that there are apparent mismatches between taxpayer groups, some more  comprehensible than others. In conclusion, mobile individuals may as a result of disparities between tax allocation, formal citizenship and voting privileges contribute financially to a state yet not having the possibility to exercise influence over their tax situation due to the lack of formal citizenship and voting privileges in said state. The group who may influence taxation and public spending (tax and spend) through voting is therefore not always the same as those who pay taxes. This issue is naturally complex as the group of individuals excluded from such political influence is a highly diverse one, reaching from high-net individuals to state-less persons seeking asylum, subject to individual circumstances and needs. The paper in itself form part of a larger body of work, done under the umbrella of Political (Tax) equity in a global context, in which I explore how increased taxpayer mobility challenges not only traditional legal frameworks associated to taxation but also the allocation of political rights and benefits. The traditional perception of citizenship as the basis for voting rights is, as is illustrated through various publications linked to the project, found inadequate when dealing with mobile taxpayers.

	",       62,"The suspension of the Non-Cooperation movement as well as the internment of Gandhi paved the way for wider ramifications. In the absence of Gandhi, the  Congress leaders were divided over the question of the strategy to be adopted. As a result, the Congress got split into two groups namely ‘No-changers’ and ‘Pro- changes’. The group led by C.R. Das which favoured the council – entry move was known as ‘Pro-changers’ and those who opposed the council entry move were called as ‘No-changers’.The “Pro-changers” included prominent leaders like C.R.Das, Motilal Nehru and Satyamuti.From a humble beginning, the Swarajya Party gained political credibility not just within the Congress circles but in the wider arena. The leaders of the party not only exhibited vision and statesmanship but also gave new direction and Orientation to Indian nationalism. In spite of ideological variances, Gandhi backed the Swarajists. He not only let them try out their programme but also handed over to them the Congress organization. Thus Swarajists took over the Congress.  They opposed Justice Party tooth and nail in Tamilnadu. Leaders like S.Satyamurti swore to uproot Justice Party. The Swarajists supported the non-Brahmins and undermined the credibility of Justice Party. Many Justicities deserted their party and swelled the ranks of the Congress.

The appointment of commission was considered as a great insult to the Indians’ sense of self-respect. There was an immediate outcry in the country over the constitution of the commission.So the entire nation rallied under Gandhi’s call for boycott of the commission which arrived in India on February 3, 1928. Wherever the commission went in Indian cities, it was greeted with black flags with the ‘Simon Go-back’ slogans.The Indian press voluntarily came forward to report the weakness of the Simon report and openly condemned the anti-Indian attitude of the members of the commission. The political literature treated the outcome of the report as just ‘eye wash’.

	",,"This paper develops methods and framework of economic theory free from general equilibrium tools and assumptions. We model macroeconomics as system of agents those perform transactions with other agents under action of numerous expectations. Agents expectations are formed by economic and financial variables, transactions, expectations of other agents, other factors that impact macro economy. We use risk ratings of agents as their coordinates on economic domain and approximate description of economic variables, transactions and expectations of numerous separate agents by density functions of variables, transactions and expectations of aggregated agents on economic domain. Motion of separate agents on economic domain due to change of agents risk rating produce economic flows of variables, transactions and expectations. These risk flows define dynamics of economic variables and disturb any supposed market equilibrium states all the time. Permanent evolution of market supply-demand states due to risk flows makes general equilibrium concept too doubtful. As example we apply our methods to model assets pricing and return fluctuations.
